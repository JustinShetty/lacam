[LaCAM](https://github.com/kei18/lacam) modified to:
- Prevent following conflicts
- Exit early upon meeting a solution threshold, i.e. number of agents that have reached their goals. Intended to be used iteratively to progressively make global progress.

## Building

All you need is [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (â‰¥v3.16). The code is written in C++(17).

First, clone this repo with submodules.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/justinshetty/early-exit-lacam.git
cd early-exit-lacam
```
Then, build the project.

```sh
cmake -B build && make -C build
```

## Usage

This fork introduces two additional command-line arguments:
```
-f, --allow_following     allow following conflicts
```
```
-T, --threshold           number of reached goals necessary to terminate. If -1, all agents must reach their goals. [default: "-1"]
```
```
--skip_post_processing    Skip potentially time-consuming post processing such as calculating sum of costs.
```
